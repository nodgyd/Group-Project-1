# Group-Project-1 | Grubn√ºb
## Description
- We aimed to solve the life long issue that plagues friend groups. Have you ever wondered why it is so difficult to eat with your friends due to different wants and needs! Well we decided to remove that problem with a randomizer that cures the illness of indecisiveness. 
- We built this project in order to save the future of friend groups and allow for consistent decision making across food locations. 
- What did you learn? We learned that you can create interactions with other apis and utilize a multitude of information in order to mold it to your liking.
